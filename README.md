This is now the setup of the post installation of osTicket for the agents and users functionality/access. I do this under my main admin account as you can see in the image above.

Here, I create a Supreme Admin role that gets overall access to the ticketing system essentially.

I now configure departments and create a department called System Administrator. I go to Admin Panel -> Agents -> Departments

I also configure a team under the name Level II Support. I went to Admin Panel -> Agents -> Teams. Level I Support already existed by default after the installation of osTicket.
